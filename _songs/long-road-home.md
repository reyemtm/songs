Life is such a long road
I hope I can find my way home

Working through life's mystery..if and where we'll be
life has its twists and turns you never know which one will end in a 
crash and burn never to return


sometimes it seems your trapped within a long series of broken dreams
and cant break free
just then out of the blue like a miracle out of the sky waiting for ou
did you feel it too

A journey of a thousand miles starts when you walk through those turnstiles

you can take the green or red I'll take the blue and go on up ahead
we'll meet someday she said
