C/G/F/G
sun is setting light the fire
playing music then retire
watch the moonrise from the bed
then lay to rest our weary heads

G/F/C
weary heads
the summer sun has bled (x2)

the temperature is rising high
a hot day even for July
take off your shirt take off your pants
jump into the pond and dance

come and dance
the summer sun has bled (x2)
