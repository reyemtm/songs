am g
give me your heart
give me your hand
take a step 
into the dark
but you havent moved yet
no you havent moved
you havent moved yet
you havent moved

well do you want it
cause its free
do you want it
cause its free

close your eyes
ease your mind
find a space
deep inside
do you see me
do you see me

do you want it 
cause its free

sit beside me
on these stones
feel or hear the tides
of the sea
can you hear it
can you hear 

do you want it
cause its free
