There are many bodies buried in the New York dust
there is anger brewing within the populous
and all the new recruits who just turned 18
they are jumping for a chance, a chance to save the king

and through the sky the bombers are soaring
and through the waves the warships are roaring
and at the gates the soldiers are waiting on 
the words of war

and who is the enemy with whom wer're now at war
and what is the freedom that we're fighting for
...
