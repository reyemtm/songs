Driving down the road 
You're high on the hog
Driving down the road
You're feeling large
But your card is gonna fall
Your card is gonna fall
Will it be lu-cky
Or will it be your number

Driving down the road
Til the sun goes down
Driving so far
You sleep on the ground
CHO
Wake up and 
the lights are red
Standing over you 
There's a cop on head
CHO
Choices we make
In life everyday
Right or wrong
They won't go away
CHO
I made it through the flop 
I made it through the turn
Can I backdoor in with a
River to burn
