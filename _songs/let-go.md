Thinking of a folk song and a time long ago
thinking of my true love hoping soon that she'll come home
thinking of a family that I never see
I hope they're thinking of me
-Chorus-
You got to know when to hold on
you got to know when to let go

A house full of strangers at the end of the road
Has become a place that I call home
And in this world of technology
so we try and tread lightly

Sitting by a bonfire in the full moon light
listening to the drums echo through the night
staring at the strangers and friends so dear
wondernig how we all came here

Watching the sparks flying up to the sky
Indians say that's how the stars got their light
knowing we're all part of a long history
and we're still struggling to be free

The nights are getting longer and the days are getting cold
some of my good friends are going down to mexico
to get a little sunshine and drink a little beer
but me I'm just sitting here...
