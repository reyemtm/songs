I was born to be a wandering man
I've wandered far and wide
I've wandered so long my roots are long gone
And I'm left alone to die

I had a family once in a while
But I do not remember their names
They gave me rest and they gave me peace
And I've never felt for shame

A sip of wine and it all floats away
The rivers thick with oil
The fish and birds and the bodies untold
Whom lives they now have spoiled
