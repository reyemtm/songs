Ramblin’ On

Capo 2

C am f G

Ramblin on
Talking about nothing until the break of dawn
Wasting time just to sit with you
And stare at the moon

Wondering why
I ever lied to you and watched you cry
And now I sit here as you stare and sigh
And tell me that its over

Love grows old
That’s a story that’s often told
But like the spring rain she’s back again
I hope that now you can forgive me

With nothing said
She looks me in the eye and tilts her head
Then I remember how our nights would end
I love you now and forever
