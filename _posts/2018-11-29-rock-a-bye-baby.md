Rock a bye ba-by by my side 
cause tonight you're gonna be mine, one more time

Round and round we dance as the fiddle plays a swing tune
here's my chance, can I have this dance

CHO Dance until the moolight fills the sky
And watch the star light twiliring on by...

Take a walk out back and take a swig of moonshine down
just this one time, you'll be feelin fine (it's allright, cause this is our night)

Then we'll go home get high and laugh 
until the morning light, and never have to say goodnight
