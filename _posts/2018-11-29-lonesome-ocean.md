We must talk in every telephone Get eaten off the web
We must rip out all the epilogues in the books that we have read
And in the face of every criminal Strapped firmly to a chair
We must stare, we must stare, we must stare
We must take all of the medicines too expensive now to sell
Set fire to the preacher who is promising us hell
And in the ear of every anarchist that sleeps but doesn't dream
We must sing, we must sing, we must sing

It'll go like this:
    F           G
While my mother waters plants
       C              F
My father loads his guns
         F                 G
He says death will give us back to god
       Am               F     G
Just like this setting sun is returned to this lonesome ocean

And then they splashed into the deep blue sea
It was a wonderful splash

We must blend into the choir Sing ecstatic with the whole
We must memorize nine numbers and deny we have a soul
And in this endless race for property and privilege to be one
We must run, we must run, we must run
We must hang up in the belfry where the bats and moonlight laugh
We must stare into a crystal ball and only see the past
And in the caverns of tomorrow With just our flashlights and our love
We must plunge, we must plunge, we must plunge

C
And then we'll get down there to the very bottom of everything
And we'll see it, we'll see it, we'll see it


Oh my mornings coming back The whole world's waking up
F G Am F
G  C F C
In the city buses are swimming past I'm happy just because
I found out I'm really no one

We Are Nowhere and It's Now

Revised

In the ear of every anarchist who sleeps but doesn't dream
we must scream we must scream we must scream

While our leaders wager peace
our soldiers load their guns (fighters load their bombs) 
Cause war will bring us close with god 
Just like the atom bomb
exploding over the lonesome ocean
